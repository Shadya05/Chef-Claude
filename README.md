# Chef-Claude

Chef-Claude is a **React-based recipe suggestion application** that helps users discover cooking ideas based on the ingredients they have. By entering available ingredients, users receive intelligent recipe recommendations, making everyday cooking easier and more creative.

## About the Project

Chef-Claude is built as a learning-focused React project to practice core frontend concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, and dynamic rendering. The application focuses on simplicity, usability, and clean UI while demonstrating how user input can drive meaningful output.

##  Features

- Enter ingredients to get recipe suggestions  
- Dynamic rendering of recipes based on user input  
- Clean and minimal user interface  
- Component-based React architecture  
- Responsive design for different screen sizes  

##  Tech Stack

- **React.js** – Frontend library  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Application logic  
- **HTML5** – Markup via JSX  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout
